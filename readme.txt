== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. What is Follow? =
Follow is just a simple plugin which adds a follow button on Wordpress.org site.(the follow button which wordpress.com users have)

= 2. Why Follow? =
Well, the answer is very simple. I and many of the Wordpress.org users(may be you too) are jealous of the follow button that appears on 
right bottom of all wordpress.com users. And I think why Wordpress.org users must be deprived from it.Thats It! 

= 3. I followed all instructions but when users subscribe to my blog via follow button it shows 404 error and page not found? =
This is because you have not made the Subscribe Page with permalink as "<your blog url address>/subscribe"
See Screenschot 3 and Installation Instructions No. 2 and 3

= 4. How can I hide the Subscribe Page? =
If you want to hide the Subscribe page go to WordPress DashBoard>>>>Pages>>>All Pages>>>Edit Subscribe Page>>>Uncheck the Show this page in navigation menu to hide the page.
See Screenshot 4 for illustration
